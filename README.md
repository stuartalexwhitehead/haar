# Honours Project
Academic year 2015â€“16 is the honours year of my Computer Science degree. A main component of this grade comes from a software development project, comprising of a report and a software implementation.

This repository contains my report. It is being written in [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) and lends itself well to version control.

\chapter{Abstract}
  The Internet of Things aims to bridge our physical and digital worlds through innovative technologies, products and services. The purpose of this project is to investigate the current landscape of the Internet of Things, including its main characteristics; why it is attracting attention from large industry players and what challenges have yet to be addressed. The project will pay particular attention to the emerging technologies which are turning this concept into a reality.

  An Internet of Things application framework will be implemented based on the findings from background research. The framework shall support the main capabilities of an IoT system with the aim of being a starting point for other developers and their own applications. A full-stack demonstration application will also be developed using the IoT framework. Not only will this present the opportunity to implement specific IoT technologies, but it will also validate decisions made for the IoT framework.

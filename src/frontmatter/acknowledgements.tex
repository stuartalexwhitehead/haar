\chapter{Acknowledgements}
  I would like to thank everyone who took an interest and showed support for my project---your encouragement has helped me to tackle what has been a challenging but interesting topic.\\

  \noindent In particular I would like thank Dr Nirmalie Wiratunga of Robert Gordon University for her guidance; Marek Pawlowski and Dr Andrew Muir Wood of Mobile User Experience for being the catalysts of my interest in IoT; the guys at FortyTwo Studio for their flexibility and enthusiasm; my parents Alan and May Whitehead for their support and my partner Teri Milton for her encouragement and understanding.

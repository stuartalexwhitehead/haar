      & 
    \\ \hline
      Devices of these networks shall be capable of establishing a connection between themselves and the web application
      & Implemented
      & This is facilitated through the bridge device
    \\ \hline
      The device networks shall comprise of two sensor devices
      & Implemented
      & Network A comprises temperature and RGB colour sensors; Network B comprises temperature and gyroscope sensors
    \\ \hline
      The device network shall contain a sensor device which measures a single data point, such as temperature
      & Implemented
      & Implemented in the form of a temperature sensor
    \\ \hline
      The device network shall contain a sensor device which measures more complex data, such as a vector of wind direction and speed
      & Implemented
      & Implemented in the form of RGB colour sensor (red, green and blue values) and gyroscope sensor (x, y and z values)
    \\ \hline
      The device networks shall comprise of a single actuator device
      & Implemented
      & Implemented as an RGB LED lamp
    \\ \hline
      The actuator device shall be flexible enough to represent a variety of data types
      & Implemented
      &
    \\ \hline
      The web-based dashboard will be the main interface between a user and their devices.
      & Implemented
      &
    \\ \hline
      The dashboard shall be accessible on the World Wide Web
      & Implemented
      & Hosted using DigitalOcean cloud server
    \\ \hline
      The dashboard shall authenticate users with a username and password
      & Implemented
      &
    \\ \hline
      The dashboard shall list profile details
      & Implemented
      &
    \\ \hline
      The user shall be able to manage their devices
      & Implemented
      &
    \\ \hline
      The dashboard shall list devices owned by the user
      & Implemented
      &
    \\ \hline
      The user shall be able to add a new device
      & Implemented
      &
    \\ \hline
      The dashboard shall show whether devices are connected or not
      & Not Implemented
      & Sensors have the ability to sleep and are therefore not `connected' all of the time, but are still active
    \\ \hline
      The user shall be able to transfer ownership of the device
      & Not Implemented
      & The required permission system to facilitate this is too involved given the time constraints
    \\ \hline
      The user shall be able to grant access permissions to other users
      & Not Implemented
      & The required permission system to facilitate this is too involved given the time constraints
    \\ \hline
      The dashboard shall enable users to manage application rules
      & Implemented
      &
    \\ \hline
      The dashboard shall list existing rules
      & Implemented
      &
    \\ \hline
      The user shall be able to create new rules
      & Implemented
      &
    \\ \hline
      An actuator device shall be able to react to sensed data
      & Implemented
      &
    \\ \hline
      User devices shall be able to integrate with third-party services
      & Implemented
      & Possible through the use of Data Access and Real-Time Event APIs
    \\ \hline
      The dashboard shall display data for a given device
      & Implemented
      &
    \\ \hline
      The dashboard shall be able to trigger actuators with virtual controls
      & Not Implemented
      & This `nice to have' was not implemented given time constraints
    \\ \hline
      A section of the dashboard shall be dedicated to data visualisation
      & Implemented
      &
    \\ \hline
      A generic visualisation tool shall plot temporal data as a graph
      & Implemented
      &
    \\ \hline
      The date range shall be configurable
      & Implemented
      &
    \\ \hline
      Multiple data sources shall be comparable on one graph interface
      & Partial
      & Multiple data points from a single device can be displayed (e.g. red, green and blue); the data from multiple devices cannot be compared
    \\ \hline
      The graph shall leverage the real-time event API to update when new data is received
      & Implemented
      &
    \\ \hline
      Specialised visualisation tools shall reflect specific device types. For example, a virtual thermometer would visualise a temperature
      & Not Implemented
      & This `nice to have' was not implemented given time constraints
    \\ \hline
      Specialised visualisation tools shall leverage the real-time event API to update when new data is received
      & Not Implemented

      The framework shall model users
      & Implemented
      &
    \\ \hline
      A user shall be identified by a unique username
      & Implemented
      &
    \\ \hline
      A user shall have an associated profile including: full name, email address
      & Implemented
      &
    \\ \hline
      Users shall be assigned a privilege level: standard or administrator
      & Implemented
      & Haar Engine understands privileges as `user' or `admin'
    \\ \hline
      The framework shall authenticate genuine users only
      & Implemented
      & Implemented with a combination of user credentials, Bcrypt password hashing and signed JSON Web Tokens
    \\ \hline
      The framework shall model connected IoT devices
      & Implemented
      &
    \\ \hline
      A device shall be identified by a unique identification number
      & Implemented
      & Devices are assigned a random, unique ID for use in data modelling. Haar Engine also stores their globally unique MAC address.
    \\ \hline
      A device shall be designated as either an input (sensor) or output (actuator)
      & Implemented
      &
    \\ \hline
      The framework shall authenticate genuine devices only
      & Implemented
      &
    \\ \hline
      The framework shall authorise and facilitate the management of devices
      & Implemented
      &
    \\ \hline
      A device will have one owner
      & Implemented
      &
    \\ \hline
      Access to device data and configuration options shall be restricted to the device owner by default
      & Implemented
      & This feature is restricted solely to the device owner and cannot be delegated.
    \\ \hline
      The device owner shall be able to make device data public
      & Implemented
      &
    \\ \hline
      A device owner shall be able to grant access permission to specified users
      & Not Implemented
      &
    \\ \hline
      The framework shall establish a connection with end devices
      & Implemented
      &
    \\ \hline
      Devices shall be addressable and identifiable whilst the connection is open
      & Implemented
      & Through the use of a publish/subscribe architecture
    \\ \hline
      The connection shall remain open under normal operating conditions
      & Implemented
      &
    \\ \hline
      Under error conditions, the connection shall be re-established
      & Implemented
      & Facilitated through the Primus real-time library
    \\ \hline
      The connection shall be bidirectional
      & Implemented
      & Implemented with WebSockets, supported by the Primus real-time library
    \\ \hline
      Input devices shall be able to transmit data packets to the framework
      & Implemented
      &
    \\ \hline
      The framework shall be able to transmit data packets to output devices
      & Implemented
      &
    \\ \hline
      The connection shall be tolerant of network obstacles such as firewalls and Network Address Translation
      & Implemented
      &
    \\ \hline
      The framework shall store data received by devices
      & Implemented
      &
    \\ \hline
      The framework shall provide an interface for using different database types
      & Not Implemented
      & Only one database type is supported: MongoDB. Its implementation is however extensible and allows developers to modify schemas.
    \\ \hline
      The framework shall provide a default ‘out of the box’ database connector
      & Implemented
      & There is only one.
    \\ \hline
      Application developers shall be able to create their own database connectors
      & Not Implemented
      &
    \\ \hline
      The framework shall provide structured access to stored data
      & Implemented
      &
    \\ \hline
      Access shall be granted to authenticated and authorised users only
      & Implemented
      &
    \\ \hline
      Application developers shall be able to modify data access
      & Implemented
      & Developers have the opportunity to implement new controllers or override existing
    \\ \hline
      Application developers shall be able to add custom data searches
      & Implemented
      & Developers have the opportunity to implement new controllers or override existing
    \\ \hline
      Application developers shall be able to add custom data filters
      & Implemented
      & Developers have the opportunity to implement new controllers or override existing
    \\ \hline
      The framework shall provide a real-time event API
      & Implemented
      & Based on MQTT's publish/subscribe model
    \\ \hline
      Client applications shall be able to listen for device events
      & Implemented
      &
    \\ \hline
      The real-time API shall leverage bidirectional connectivity with devices
      & Implemented
      &
    \\ \hline
      The API shall provide real-time access to data received from devices
      & Implemented
      &
    \\ \hline
      The real-time API shall enable developers to create application rules and triggers
      & Implemented
      &
    \\ \hline

\chapter{Design}
\label{chapter:design}
   The purpose of this chapter is to document architectural design decisions for Haar and the underlying Haar Engine. It is an important stage in the development of these system components because it combines the requirements specified in Chapter \ref{Chapter:Specification} and the knowledge gained in Chapter \ref{Chapter:Background}. The process has been highly iterative and has led to the upcoming system architecture. 

   One fact which has become clear throughout the design process is that the design and implementation are not mutually exclusive. Some ideas presented in Chapter \ref{Chapter:Background} are dependant on specific technologies, such as the ability to facilitate bidirectional communication (Section \ref{bidirectioncomms}). For this project, the available tools and technologies have therefore informed the design, and this has been integrated to the design process.

   The design process for each functional requirement has consisted of three iterative stages, as shown in Figure \ref{figure:design-process}. First of all, the initial research is consulted to check if any knowledge could inform the design. The requirement and existing knowledge were then used as a basis as a small feasibility investigation for various technologies. Based on these findings, the design was updated. This process was repeated for individual requirements, as well as between requirements to ensure the complete system will operate adequately.

  \section{Haar Engine}
    The first component to get design attention is Haar Engine. Since this will support the main system functions required for IoT applications, its design is heavily informed by the available technologies.

    One major design decision is the programming environment used to implement Haar Engine. It is important because it informs how the code can be structured. First of all, the chosen programming language and ecosystem must be able to support the requirements outlined in the previous chapter. Beyond that, the language and framework must provide suitable constructs so application developers can easily extend and modify for their own needs. Various languages and architectures were investigated (such as PHP, Ruby, Python and Go), however one stood out as being most suitable for this project: Node.js.

    Node.js is a server-side implementation of JavaScript. More specifically it implements Google's V8 JavaScript engine and it is ideal for this project due to its event-driven nature. In general, it is based on the event loop concurrency model - a single-threaded process which loops continuously over a message queue \citep{event-loop}. Haar Engine is expected to be focussed on input and output operations. I/O operations using more traditional technologies such as PHP, Python and Ruby are synchronous in nature and block further execution of the process. In comparison, JavaScript can continue processing other instructions while waiting for an IO operation to complete.

    There are various web application frameworks developed on top of Node.js, with the \textit{de facto} standard being Express. The Express framework is based on the concept of middleware, where middleware functions anonymously pass objects to the next one until a web request has been completed. This concept could therefore be used to an advantage for system aspects like authentication.

    Bearing these language features in mind, a final design for the framework has been defined. A logical view of the main system components can be seen in Figure \ref{figure:framework-architecture}. The design decisions for each of these framework components have been described in the following subsections.

    \subsection{Data Modelling}
      The functional requirements in Chapter \ref{Chapter:Specification} make reference to a number of modellable objects. These are users, devices and rules, and they all have a notion of ownership and authorisation within the framework. During initial research, it was found that an existing platform (Nitrogen.io) abstracts similar objects into a collection called principals. Throughout the design process, users, devices and rules have have proven to be first-class citizens of the framework, so Haar Engine will adopt the same terminology.

      The three principal objects set foundations for the complete data model as well as other framework components, so it is important that they are modelled correctly. This subsection will first describe the traits of each principle before expanding their relationships into an entity-relationship model. Figure \ref{figure:principal-models} illustrates the relationship between the principals.

      \subsubsection{Users}
        The user principal is fundamentally responsible for authorisation within Haar Engine. This will model an end-user account such as an individual person or a company, who will access their account using a unique username and a password. The user is responsible for managing their own devices and rules. Haar Engine will identify user principals with a unique identifier. This would allow users to change their username while maintaining relationships with other principals.

        User principals will be the gatekeeper to devices associated with their account. First of all, they will be able to attach new devices to their account. Users will also have the ability to share access to sensor devices with specific users, or make that data publicly available. Finally, user principals will have the ability to transfer ownership of the device to another Haar Engine user account and relinquish administration control over it.

        User principals will also be able to create, modify and delete rules. When a new rule is created, the user will be designated as the owner of it. Unlike devices, users cannot share rules with another user, nor can they transfer ownership. It is foreseeable that a rule is configured to watch sensor data which is owner by another user. Since access to a third-party sensor cannot be granted, the rule would not have appropriate access permissions to run.

      \subsubsection{Devices}
        The device principal will model a single IoT device. The device can be one of two types (either a sensor or an actuator). Devices will be owned by one user, however further users may be granted access to sensor data. Devices will be identifiable with a unique identifier in Haar Engine. This identifier will be used for the purpose of authentication and authorisation against user principals.

        The device model will also describe the type of data which it supports. For sensor devices, the principal will note the type of measurement (a single value or a vector of values) and the unit(s) of measurement. In the case of actuators, the principal will describe possible output types (single value or a vector of values), as well as value limits. These data type descriptions will be used when defining rules.

      \subsubsection{Rules}
        Rule principals define triggers within the Haar Engine. They are created and owned by a user principal. A rule will consist of a watch target, trigger criteria (such as threshold values), an action target and an action. The watch target is a sensor to monitor and when changes are detected, its output values will be compared against trigger criteria. If the criteria is met, the action target (actuator) will be updated in accordance with the action to take.

      \subsubsection{Entity Relationship Model}

      \end{itemize}

      4. Constraints and Assumptions
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Device Type structure is an array of objects. Each object describes a possible measurement.
        \item The Device Type of a device will never change
      \end{itemize}
    \subsection{Database Connector}
    \label{section:database-connector}
      Efficient data storage is an important performance consideration. The requirements in Chapter \ref{Chapter:Specification} also state that application developers should have the ability to change the database type to suit their own application. The design solution arrived at for this requirement is a database connector API.

      The database connector API will provide a set of foundation methods for operating on principal models and data generated by devices. The framework will use a consistent programming interface and this will allow application developers to change the connector for one of their own design. In a more strictly-typed programming language, object-oriented constructs such as abstract classes or interfaces might be used to define class signatures. With JavaScript, programming techniques like function composition might be more appropriate. 

      Whilst Haar Engine will provide the capability of changing the database connector, an `out of the box' connector will be provided. A NoSQL database fits the purpose of the framework better than an SQL-based database because the data stored could be of varying formats and structures. There are a variety of NoSQL databases available, which will be discussed in the implementation chapter.

    \subsection{Data Access API}
      There are a number of mature standards used for structured data access on the web, so this requirement of the project is about choosing the most appropriate. Two widely-used access standards are Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) and Representational State Transfer (REST). These standards also use data interchange formats such as eXtensible Mark-up Language (XML) or JavaScript Object Notation (JSON).

      A REST API was found to be a better fit than SOAP for the Haar Engine. The REST access operators integrate much easier with potential implementation technologies like Node.js and Express and it is a simpler standard to use. The JSON data interchange format is based on JavaScript object constructs so it naturally integrates with a JavaScript-based application.

      Authentication will have to be enforced by every component of the Haar Engine, including the Data Access API. One characteristic of REST APIs is that they are stateless, meaning no session data is stored server-side and that every request will have to be inspected for appropriate access permissions. Two authentication techniques which will be used are a username and password combination, as well as token-based authentication. Clients will first authenticate with their username and password and if accepted, the REST API will return a unique access token for use in subsequent requests.

    \subsection{Real-Time Event API}
      One main characteristic of IoT is the ability to react on sensor data in real-time. This makes a robust and effective real-time API a priority for any given application. Giving structured access to this feature is challenging due to the points described in Section \ref{bidirectioncomms}. For this reason, the problem has been divided into two constituent components: opening and maintaining a true bidirectional communication channel, and efficiently handling messages between the two nodes of the channel.

      One technology which goes some distance in helping with this is MQTT. As described in Section \ref{section:mqtt}, MQTT is a publish-subscribe protocol which facilitates the transmission of messages. MQTT is a very robust protocol however given project constraints and the additional complexity which it might create, it has been deemed unfeasible for this project. Instead, the JavaScript project Socket.io can open and maintain WebSocket connections, with fallbacks if the WebSocket protocol is unavailable. The message-passing concepts of MQTT could be applied to Socket.io.

      \subsubsection{Connection Manager}
        The connection manager is responsible for navigating potential network issues to maintain a bidirectional communication channel. Choosing to use Socket.io and the WebSocket protocol should alleviate any of the issues regarding firewalls and NAT. Socket.io provides an API for managing WebSocket connections. Clients can connect to namespaced URIs which encapsulate different categories of client---Haar Engine will use two default namespaces: sensors and actuators.

        It is also the responsibility of the connection manager to authenticate clients, whether they are users or devices. Socket.io also solves this problem with the use of its own middleware capability. This middleware could make use of authentication mechanisms already in place for the Data Access API.

      \subsubsection{Stream Processor}
        Once a connection has been established, it is the responsibility of the stream processor to act on messages. The Socket.io API allows clients to join one or more rooms within a given namespace and this capability will be leveraged by the stream processor. For example, multiple sensors will each have their own room under the sensor namespace. The stream processor can listen for any sensor events and store the data. Alternatively, stream processing rules (based on the rule principal object) could listen for messages in a single sensor room and act accordingly.

  \section{Haar}
    The main purpose of the second component, Haar, is to validate the implementation of Haar Engine. Most of the heavy lifting will be done by Haar Engine, however this application also requires design attention, especially in regards to the end devices. There are three main components to be investigated: the back-end application, front-end application (dashboard) and the Wireless Sensor Network itself.

    \subsection{Back-End Application}
      The back-end application is simply an instance of the Haar Engine. It is expected that the data models will be extended for one or two application-specific fields (such as a profile picture and biography for users) however it will generally be left as designed. The back-end application will be self-contained and separate from the front-end application. 

    \subsection{Front-End Application}
    \label{section:front-end-application}
      The front-end application is, in essence, simply a user interface for the back-end APIs. It will make use of the Data Access API and Real-Time Event API to manage users, devices, rules and the authentication for all of them. The main challenge presented by the dashboard is handling very dynamic, real-time data in a structured and efficient way for a variety web browsers. The implementation details of this will be discussed in detail as part of the next chapter.

      What can be discussed at this stage is the design, layout and behaviour of the user interface. Figure \ref{figure:desktop-layout} illustrates the general layout which will be used. On desktop-sized web browsers, the window will be split into two panes---one used for navigation, and one for displaying the current page content. On mobile-sized web browsers, only one pane will be displayed at a time. By default, this will be the content pane and when the navigation button is clicked, the navigation pane will be shown.

      The behaviour of the user interface is a challenging aspect. It is expected that aspects of the user interface will react in real-time to new data, so it will also have to open a connection to the Real-Time Event API. This will be possible by using the Socket.io library client-side. The challenges begin when the user starts to navigate to different pages of the dashboard. Traditionally this would load a completely new page, however real-time connections would have to be renegotiated and this is inefficient. Instead, dashboard pages will be loaded asynchronously. Care must then be taken to achieving this in a structured way with in its implementation.

              {\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{assets/desktop-layout.png}};
          \end{tikzpicture}
        \caption{UI layout for desktop-sized web browsers}\label{figure:desktop-layout}
      \end{figure}

    \subsection{Wireless Sensor Networks}
      The third and final component for the Haar application is the Wireless Sensor Network. The WSN comprises of the physical sensors and actuators which create an interface between the physical and digital worlds. To fully demonstrate the capability of the Haar Engine, there is a requirement for a variety of sensor types.

      Before designing individual devices it is first important to plan the data flow between them. It has already been decided that the Haar Engine will support bidirectional communication through the use of the WebSocket protocol, meaning that end devices must also support it. However, to maintain a persistent WebSocket connection any given end device must be awake 100\% of the time. IoT devices should be as power efficient as possible and maintaining a WebSocket connection would prevent them from being able to sleep. Similarly, the WebSocket protocol requires extra software overhead to manage connections; simpler, more efficient protocols already exist for IoT device communication.

      As described in Section \ref{section:connectivity}, ZigBee is a lightweight wireless communication protocol ideal for use in IoT solutions. ZigBee, however, is not compatible with the TCP/IP protocol used for Internet communications. To compromise on this issue, a bridge solution will be used. A bridge device will maintain the WebSocket connection with the Real-Time Event API; when a WebSocket packet is received, the bridge will translate it into a ZigBee packet and vice-versa. This system architecture is shown in Figure \ref{figure:wsn-architecture}.

        \end{tikzpicture}
      \caption{System architecture for Haar devices}\label{figure:wsn-architecture}
    \end{figure}

      \subsubsection{End Devices}
        To successfully demonstrate the IoT framework, a number of devices are required. Ideally, these devices should be a true representation of an IoT device and not just mocked using software emulation. For the purpose of this project, a true IoT device is considered as having constrained resources, low power and inexpensive components.

        Out of the hardware platforms investigated in Section \ref{sensor-hardware}, the Arduino development platform is the most suited. The Arduino hardware boards and software tools are open source giving complete transparency to their implementation. The Arduino IDE also comes packaged with all the software required to develop and compile the c/c++ based programs. There are a variety of hardware boards and accessories and they are all inexpensive and widely available.

        Most Arduino boards have limited connectivity and very rarely have a wireless option built in. As a result, an additional Radio Frequency (RF) hardware component is required. After researching available hardware, the XBee radio chip is the only feasible solution which supports the ZigBee protocol. The XBee chip is a very flexible device and actually contains its own microcontroller. This characteristic will allow Haar devices to delegate communication duties to the XBee device whilst only needing to manage the interpretation of sensor data itself. Another benefit of using XBee is that configuration and debugging software is available for computers.

        Section \ref{section:demonstration-application-spec} stated that devices with enough diversity are required to fully demonstrate the IoT concept. Thought was first given to the output device; this was required to be flexible enough to reflect a variety of sensor data. An existing IoT product called the Good Night Lamp provided inspiration for this device. The Good Night Lamp is a cellular-connected bedside lamp in a master-slave configuration. When the slave lamp is turned off, the master lamp will also turn off, no matter where in the world they may be located. The developers behind this product suggest that this creates an emotive connection with a loved one, such as that between a child and their travelling parent.

        To build on the concept of the Good Night Lamp, the output device for Haar will be an RGB colour lamp. Firstly, an RGB actuator like this has three data channels---red, green and blue. This characteristic can be used to demonstrate a vector of sensor data being transformed and used to trigger an output. Additionally, colours can add additional meaning to a context. For example, if used to reflect a temperature, a blue colour suggests coldness whereas a red colour suggests warmth. This subjectiveness adds a nice human aspect to the device.

        Three different input devices will also be built. In order to demonstrate the temperature example just discussed, a sensor which measures the ambient temperature will be developed. The temperature sensor only measures one datapoint, so further devices which measure a vector of data will also be required. Since the output devices is an RGB lamp, it would be nice to demonstrate an RGB colour sensor, too. Each channel of the RGB sensor could be mapped to the respective channel on the output so it simply relays the sensor colour. Finally, a 3-axis gyroscope sensor will be built. Since the gyroscope has 3 axis (x, y and z), they can each be mapped to a channel of the output device. Depending on its sensitivity, a gyroscope could produce a high volume of data, so it will be useful when testing the limitations of the system.

        The next stage in planning the devices is to design their schematics. Section \ref{section:io} discussed how the operating voltage is an important consideration and that it affects battery life and compatibility with sensor chips. Most Arduino boards operate at 5V however a number of models operate at 3.3v, such as the Arduino Pro Mini as noted in Table \ref{hardware-boards}. The XBee radio chip also operates at 3.3v, so this would be a suitable system voltage to use.

        In terms of the sensors components, there are two varieties to choose from: analogue or digital. Analogue components are very cheap, widely available and very robust but often require extra calibration steps to glean accurate results. In comparison, digital components are more expensive but often come packaged with helper libraries, use well-supported digital protocols and take accurate readings `out of the box.' Since this project is up against tough time constraints, the extra support provided by digital components makes them more suitable for this project.

        The following diagrams illustrate prototype circuits for all device types. There are a number of common characteristics between them which can be explained first. The XBee Explorer is an expander board for XBee radio chips and exposes a prototype-friendly pinout. The basic pins (power, ground, serial in and serial out) are connected to the Arduino board, along with two more pins: CTS and DTR. These are represented by the yellow and orange wires respectively. The CTS pin can be used to determine when the XBee chip is ready to receive data, and the DTR pin can be used to send the XBee chip to sleep. Additionally, the grey and brown wires are used to connect digital sensor chips to the Arduino.

      \subsubsection{Bridge}
        Since the purpose of the bridge device is to translate packets between TCP- and ZigBee-based protocols, it requires a different design approach to the end devices. This device must be able to support multiple modes of connectivity. Its software stack must be able to open and maintain a WebSocket connection as well as to parse and transmit ZigBee packets. The additional overhead of supporting multiple communication protocols means that this device will require more system resources than a simple microcontroller. At the same time, this prototype device should remain inexpensive and developer-friendly.

        Out of the hardware platforms summarised in Table \ref{hardware-boards}, the Raspberry Pi  model 2 (RPi2) bests fits this criteria. The RPi2 has a native ethernet port which would allow it to interface with the Internet. Additionally, it provides a number of GPIO pins which could be used to interface with its own XBee radio chip. A combination of these two features means it can satisfy the connectivity requirements. The RPi2 is also a fully-fledged computer with a 32-bit, quad-core CPU running at 900MHz and 1GB of RAM. These specifications are more than sufficient to service resource demands.

        The Raspberry Pi community manage a Linux distribution for use on the platform. Since this will be used as the operating system, any program which runs on Linux could be used to implement the bridge software. For the same reasons Node.js is being used to develop the Haar Engine (non-blocking I/O operations, real-time libraries) it will be used to implement the Haar Bridge. The Socket.io client library can also be used for managing the WebSocket connection on the RPi2. The RPi2 will interface with the XBee chip using the serial GPIO pins.

        Figure \ref{figure:bridge} illustrates the bridge device prototype. Since this device is expected to handle many more IO operations than an end device, both of the hardware flow control pins (CTS and RTS) from the XBee have been connected to the RPi2. These are illustrated by the yellow and orange wires.
